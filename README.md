# Main Quick Quiz Frontend
## Frontend for our quiz game QuickQuiz
This is a project that my friend Eron and I developed for our school hackathon. We did not finish this project, but the concept is mostly complete. Our original goal for the project was to create a quiz game that could automatically generate questions from a simple prompt. You would then be able to start a game so other users can join and play together, similar to a Kahoot. We initially wanted to OpenAIs GPT3 API to do the question and answer generation, but we ran into issues getting a predictable output that can be easily parsed. We tried Few-Shot learning, but that still gave mixed results that were not usable. After all the issues with the AI aspects of the game, we decided to focus our efforts on the game play itself. I built most of the frontend components like the question answering view, and Eron made the rest of the components like the waiting page. We used Svelte as our frontend framework because I've used it in the past and I like its simple operation. The only issue with Svelte is the animations. There is minimal documentation on creating custom animation and we found that to be very frustrating. Other than that, the development process was very easy and the collaboration between me and Eron went smoothly. If I have some time this summer, I look forward to finishing it and expanding the concept.
